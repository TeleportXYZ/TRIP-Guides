## What is an App

An app is a software client that allows riders and drivers to access the TRIP protocol.

Think of a web browser like Chrome that allows you to access the internet or a mail app like Gmail that allows you to send and receive email.

The first app on the TRIP protocol is [Teleport](https://www.teleport.xyz/).

Because TRIP is an open protocol in time there will be multiple apps like Teleport built on TRIP.

This allows for greater experimentation and innovation leading to a better rideshare experience for both riders and drivers.

## How to create an App

As mentioned above, the TRIP protocol is not fully decentralized at this time. Public API documentation or developer SDKs for TRIP have not yet been released. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Apps.
