This guide documents the basics of TRIP Verifiers.

Verifiers validate assertions made by the different roles on the TRIP protocol.

After reading this guide, you will know:

## What is a Verifier

A verifier validate assertions made by the different roles on the TRIP protocol.

For example, if a driver provides a driver's license, a verifier inspects the license and validates whether it is a valid driver's license or not.

Verifiers not only inspect driver licenses they also perform car inspections, conduct background checks and verify phone numbers.

Once a verifier has validated an assertion, they provide a cryptographic attestation (think stamp of approval) that the assertion is true.

Therefore, verifiers play a crucial role in establishing trust and credibility when traditional centralized authorities are not present.

## How to become a Verifier

Verifiers must be in legal and operational compliance with all applicable regulations and laws before they begin providing attestation services to the protocol.

To ensure that Verifiers are compliant with local regulation and operational requirements, the TRIP Marketplace votes to deputize dedicated auditing firms. These firms receive authorization by multi-sig keys to sign off on the regulatory and operational readiness of Verifiers.

Once Verifiers have been approved by a majority multi-sig vote, they are publicly listed on the contract together with their public key and DNS address, as well as additional metadata such as geographic zones of operation.

As mentioned above, the TRIP protocol is not fully decentralized at this time. Demonstrating Verifier eligibility does not guarantee you will be added to the network. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Verifiers.

If you or your firm would like to be considered as a Verifier on TRIP, [reach out to us](mailto:verifier@dec.dev).
