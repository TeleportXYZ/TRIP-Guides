## Introduction

### What is a Verifier on TRIP?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Attestations (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Verifiers on the TRIP network are responsible for validating the accuracy of information provided by different roles within the protocol. For example, when a driver submits their driver’s license, a Verifier inspects and confirms the validity of the license. Verifiers also perform vehicle inspections, conduct background checks, and verify phone numbers.&#x20;

Once a Verifier has validated an assertion, they provide a cryptographic attestation—essentially a stamp of approval—that the information is accurate. This role is critical for establishing trust and credibility within the TRIP network, especially in the absence of traditional centralized authorities.

### The Importance of Verifiers

As the TRIP network grows, Verifiers will become increasingly essential to maintaining the integrity and reliability of the protocol. By providing accurate and trustworthy attestations, Verifiers ensure that all participants—drivers, riders, and other stakeholders—can participate with confidence. Verifiers help uphold the decentralized nature of TRIP while ensuring that safety and regulatory standards are met.

### Not Adding New Verifiers Presently

New Verifiers are not presently being added to the TRIP network. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Verifiers. As a future Verifier, earn rewards as an Ambassador today.

## Contributing Now

### Become an Ambassador

Today you can earn rewards on the TRIP network as an Ambassador. Ambassadors promote TRIP, recruit new riders and drivers, and help build a strong local community. As an Ambassador, you earn TRIP Miles every time someone you referred rides or drives—even if you were not the Verifier responsible for verifying the driver or rider. This is an extremely effective way for entrepreneurial, ambitious individuals to earn rewards and play a key role in the network's growth.&#x20;
