# Uruguay

* The operator must legally register as a company against social-security-agency ([BPS](https://www.bps.gub.uy/19382/banco-de-prevision-social.html)) and tax-agency ([DGI](https://servicios.dgi.gub.uy/serviciosenlinea)).
* The operator must have an _electronic address_ for legal invoicing (registered email account).
* The operator must arrange a meeting with Montevideo's municipal Transport Department. The idea is to introduce them to Teleport and its workflow (_I assume this is only needed for the first few operators_). Here I leave a contact email of the [transport division](mailto:consultas.tpvp@imm.gub.uy) and a phone number +598 1950-9274.
