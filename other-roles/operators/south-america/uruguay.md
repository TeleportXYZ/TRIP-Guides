# Uruguay

* The operator must legally register as a company against social-security-agency ([BPS](https://www.bps.gub.uy/19382/banco-de-prevision-social.html)) and tax-agency ([DGI](https://servicios.dgi.gub.uy/serviciosenlinea)).
* The operator must have an _electronic address_ for legal invoicing (registered email account).
* The operator must arrange a meeting with Montevideo's municipal Transport Department. The idea is to introduce them to Teleport and its workflow (_I assume this is only needed for the first few operators_). Here I leave a contact email of the [transport division](mailto:consultas.tpvp@imm.gub.uy) and a phone number +598 1950-9274.

Before taking action, it is advised to consult with legal and business professionals well-versed in the laws and regulations of Uruguay. Laws and regulations are subject to change, and the steps provided might not encompass all details or be current at the time of your reading.
