**What is an Operator?**

An Operator handles the regulatory and operational requirements of providing rideshare service.

**What are the requirements of an Operator?**

All Operators must be validated on the network by an Auditor. At a minimum, all Operators:

* Must establish mechanisms for registering and responding to customer requests and complaints.
* Have credible and qualified owners and leadership.
* Must have a valid rideshare license and rideshare insurance.

#### **What responsibilities does an Operator have?**

Operators must obtain licenses and insurance, and be operationally prepared to comply with regulatory and safety requirements in each geography they wish to serve, before they can begin matching riders and drivers within those locations.

Operators who operate using the TRIP protocol are subject to the same requirements as rideshare operators who operate outside the TRIP protocol. This includes:

* Full compliance with all applicable local regulations and laws.
* Handling customer support requests.
* Cooperating with law enforcement.
* Resolving disputes and issuing refunds.

#### **What is the benefit of becoming an Operator?**

Operators connect drivers and riders and get compensated with a percentage of fares, as well as network rewards issued by the protocol.

Running an operator is running a business that enables the rideshare network to operate.

#### How does operating an Operator work?

After Operators have acquired licensing and insurance, they use software called a “rideshare server” that helps them connect drivers & riders as well as handle customer support requests. Most of the work involved is fairly automated and straightforward.

#### Can there be more than one operator in an area?

Yes. One of the reasons prices on TRIP are fairer is that multiple Operators can compete on pricing in any given area.

#### How do I get started?

The process will require you to get a license from your state, country, or municipality, and get all the required insurance. An auditor will then validate that your business is capable of and permitted to operate.
