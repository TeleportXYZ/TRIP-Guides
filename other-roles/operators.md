## Introduction

### What is an Operator on TRIP?

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Operators on the TRIP network are responsible for handling the regulatory and operational requirements necessary to provide rideshare services within a specific geographic area.&#x20;

This includes obtaining the necessary licenses and insurance, complying with local regulations, and matching riders with drivers. Operators also provide customer support, addressing rider and driver questions, resolving disputes, and coordinating with local authorities when needed.

Operators do not have exclusive relationships with drivers. Through the Teleport app, drivers can and will be sent ride requests by multiple operators at the same time.

### The importance of Operators

As the TRIP network grows, more Operators will join the network providing rideshare matching services around the world. Because there will be multiple Operators, take rates and prices will be kept competitive. This results in drivers earning more and riders paying less.

### Not Adding New Operators Presently

New Operators are not being added to the TRIP network presently. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Operators. As a future Operator, earn rewards as an Ambassador today.

## Contributing Now

### Become an Ambassador

Today you can earn rewards on the TRIP network as an Ambassador. Ambassadors promote TRIP, recruit new riders and drivers, and help build a strong local community. As an Ambassador, you earn TRIP Miles every time someone you referred rides or drivesâ€”even if you were not the Operator responsible for matching the driver with the rider. This is an extremely effective way for entrepreneurial, ambitious individuals to earn rewards and play a key role in the network's growth.&#x20;
