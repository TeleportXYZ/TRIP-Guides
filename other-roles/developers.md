## Introduction

### What is a Developer on TRIP?

Developers on the TRIP network play a crucial role in creating the software clients, or apps, that allow riders and drivers to access and interact with the TRIP protocol. Just as a web browser like Chrome allows you to explore the internet or an email client like Gmail lets you send and receive messages, an app on TRIP enables users to ride or drive on the network.&#x20;

The first app built on the TRIP protocol is Teleport, but as TRIP evolves, more apps will be developed, allowing for greater experimentation, innovation, and a richer experience for both riders and drivers.

### The Importance of Developers

Developers are at the forefront of innovation within the TRIP ecosystem.&#x20;

By building diverse and innovative apps on the TRIP protocol, they enhance the rideshare experience, offering users more choices and better services. As TRIP grows, the contribution of Developers will be vital in driving the decentralized rideshare revolution, ensuring that the protocol remains flexible, user-friendly, and at the cutting edge of technology.

### Not Adding New Developers Presently

New Developers are not presently being added to the network. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Developers. As a future Developer, [earn rewards as an Ambassador](../ambassadors/basics.md) today.

## Contributing Now

### Become an Ambassador

Today you can earn rewards on the TRIP network as an Ambassador. Ambassadors promote TRIP, recruit new riders and drivers, and help build a strong local community. As an Ambassador, you earn TRIP Miles every time someone you referred rides or drivesâ€”even if you were not the Developer responsible for the app the driver and rider used. This is an extremely effective way for entrepreneurial, ambitious individuals to earn rewards and play a key role in the network's growth.&#x20;
