Auditors verify that Operators and Verifiers are legally permitted and capable of fulfilling their assigned roles on the newtork. Auditors ensure Operators and Verifiers meet the necessary legal and operational standards before they begin their activities. This helps to build trust within the network.

### The Importance of Auditors

Their role is critical in maintaining the network’s credibility and ensuring that it operates smoothly and transparently. As TRIP expands, the contribution of Auditors will become increasingly important in upholding the network’s standards and fostering trust among users.

### Not Adding New Auditors Presently

This is an extremely effective way for entrepreneurial, ambitious individuals to earn rewards and play a key role in the network's growth.&#x20;
