**Note:** The TRIP protocol is not fully decentralized at this time. Demonstrating Auditor eligibility does not guarantee you will be added to the network. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Auditors.

## What is an Auditor

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Authorization (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An Auditor is a firm or individual authorized by the governance of the TRIP Marketplace to verify that Operators and Verifiers are legally permitted and operationally capable of fulfilling their assigned roles on the network.

## How to become an Auditor

As mentioned above, the TRIP protocol is not fully decentralized at this time. Demonstrating Auditor eligibility does not guarantee you will be added to the network. Guidance will be provided when the network is ready for more Auditors.
