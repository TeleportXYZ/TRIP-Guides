# Atomic Network Estimates

We use rideshare simulations to estimate the atomic network for each city.

Here is a list of cities weâ€™ve prepared estimates for to date.

Right now, there might not be an estimate for your specific city.

In that case, look for a similar city to get an idea of how many riders and drivers will be needed.

We will add more cities to this list and update the estimates over time. Check back regularly.
