## Viewing Signups with the TRIP Explorer

You can use the TRIP Explorer to view signups on the TRIP protocol.

Each dot on the map corresponds to a location anonymized signup.

A **signup** is anyone that has downloaded the Teleport iOS app and accepted an invite.

You can also view the weekly growth rate of signups.

The **weekly growth rate** of signups is:

$$
\frac{\text{# of weekly signups}}{\text{# of total signups}}
$$

Where **total signups** is the total signups prior to the week's signups.

## Green Regions in the TRIP Explorer

Any green regions on the map have an approved operator ready to facilitate trips.

Therefore all cities within a green region are eligible to be added to the TRIP network.

Check back regularly to see more TRIP regions turn green.

## Finding your city with the TRIP Explorer

The TRIP Explorer uses 3D mapping software to display a map of the world.

You can scroll left to right, up and down, as well as zoom in and out.

Use these capabilities to find your city and zoom in to see local network activity.

## What's next for the TRIP Explorer

More features will be added to the TRIP Explorer in time.
