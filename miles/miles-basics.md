# Miles Basics

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [cash out instructions](broken-reference) page, if you are looking to move your rewards from the Teleport app to another wallet
{% endhint %}

TRIP Miles build up until someone claims them. That means if no rides have happened for the last 10 minutes, all rides that end on the 10th minute receive 10x the TRIP Miles they usually would and the counter restarts. These rollover miles can really stack up so make sure you get on the road early and often to increase your chances of getting them!

### How can I earn more TRIP Miles?

1. Taking more or longer trips.
2. Inviting friends who take trips.
3. Inviting friends who invite their friends who take trips.

### How does inviting friends who invite their friends earn me TRIP Miles?

Whenever someone you invite rides or drives, you earn TRIP Miles.

If that person you invited also invites others who ride or drive, you earn TRIP Miles for their trips too. You earn about 3x fewer TRIP Miles than when you directly invited the rider or driver.

Lastly, if those riders or drivers invite people who ride or drive, you earn TRIP Miles on those trips as well. In that case, you earn about 7.5x fewer TRIP Miles than when you directly invited the rider or driver.

Even though you earn fewer TRIP Miles the further down the chain, the Miles can add up quickly, especially if you have active riders or drivers or people with large, engaged audiences in your chain.

### What can I do with TRIP Miles?

TRIP Miles can be used to claim TRIP Rewards.

TRIP Rewards are digital collectibles and one way to think of them is as recorded work on the network through TRIP’s proof-of-ride system.

### How do I sell TRIP Rewards?

The Teleport app has support to help you sell on the Tensor secondary market. Here's how this works:

1. Tap on the Rewards tab in the app.
2. Tap on your TRIP Reward.
3. Tap "Redeem Reward".

That's it!

To confirm the sale, check your wallet balance and you should be all set!

From there, you can [cash out](broken-reference) your wallet balance directly to your bank account.
