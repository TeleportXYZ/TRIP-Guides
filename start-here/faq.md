Just ask in the group chat. Community members are friendly and will be quick to give you one.

#### **Is the TRIP Community also on Discord?**

The TRIP Community is not on Discord.

### How can I buy the token?

There is no token currently. We’re focused on building a great decentralized rideshare experience. We have done research on potentially using tokens for governance, but it’s not our current focus and we have nothing to announce.

#### What are TRIP Rewards?

TRIP Rewards are digital collectibles that users can claim for driving, riding, and inviting drivers and riders [https://trip.dev/rewards](https://trip.dev/rewards). One way to think of them is as recorded work on the network through TRIP’s proof-of-ride system.

Use TRIP Miles to claim your first TRIP Reward.

#### What are TRIP Miles?

TRIP Miles are reward points you earn by riding, driving, or inviting other active riders or drivers.

#### How can I earn more TRIP Miles?

You can earn more TRIP Miles by:

1. Taking more or longer trips.
2. Inviting friends who take trips.
3. Inviting friends who invite their friends who take trips.

So whether you ride or drive, you will want to spread the word.

Message your friends your invite link, have them take trips, and earn more TRIP Miles today.

### Is the app available on Android?

Being on Android is important to us.

We don’t have a release date we can share yet but it’s on our radar.

Join the waitlist here: [https://www.teleport.xyz/waitlist](https://www.teleport.xyz/waitlist).

#### Is there a way I can participate until then?

You can purchase an iPhone to get access to the app and invite others.

If you have a friend or family member with an iPhone you can have them install the app and invite others.

Keep in mind you won't be able to transfer their invite code to your phone in the future. The invite code is connected to them and their device. Otherwise, you'll have to sit tight.

We don’t have a release date for Android we can share yet but it’s on our radar.

### Can my iPhone run the app?

Any iPhone compatible with iOS 17 can run the app.

For a full list of iPhone versions, check [Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/iphone-models-compatible-with-ios-17-iphe3fa5df43/ios).

### Is the app available in my city?

Right now, the app is probably not available in your city.

That said, we want to be in your city as soon as possible.

Today, we are live in College Station, TX and Austin, TX.

From there, which cities are next live on the network will be community driven.

#### How can I help bring the app to my city?

The best way to bring the app to your city is to sign up riders and drivers. Lots of them.

Why? First, your city needs an atomic network of riders and drivers. An atomic network is the smallest possible network that is stable and can grow on its own.

Second, the city needs at least one licensed rideshare operator. In the US, rideshare licensing is typically at the state level. So if an operator is licensed in Texas, every city in Texas has met this requirement.

Today, there is at least one licensed operator on TRIP in Texas, Florida, Arizona, and Indiana.

If your city is in one of these states, all that’s needed is reaching the atomic network. If your city is not in one of these states, someone needs to become an operator still.

#### How many riders and drivers are needed for an atomic network in my city?

We use Agent Based Modeling to estimate the atomic network for each city.

Here is a list of cities we’ve prepared estimates for to date: [https://trip.dev/cities](https://trip.dev/cities).

Right now, there might not be an estimate for your specific city.

In that case, look for a similar city to get an idea of how many riders and drivers will be needed.

We will add more cities to this list and update the estimates over time. Check back regularly.

#### How can I sign up riders in my city?

In the app:

1. On the "Ride" page find the “Invite to Earn Rewards” card.
2. Either tap the Share button or the QR code button to share your link.

From there, they will:

1. Install the app.
2. Either enter your invite code or scan your QR code again.

They are now signed up as a rider.

#### How can I sign up drivers in my city?

In the app:

1. On the "Ride" page find the “Invite to Earn Rewards” card.
2. Either tap the Share button or the QR code button to share your link.

From there, they will:

1. Install the app.
2. Either enter your invite code or scan your QR code again.

They are now signed up as a rider.

Next on their phone in the app have them:

1. Click “Become a driver” on the “TRIP” tab.

From there they will submit a driver application by answering a few questions.

When your city is ready to go live, they will complete an onboarding process before activating.

#### How can I speed up bringing the app to my city?

Our goal is to be in as many cities as possible as soon as possible.

To start, our team will have more influence over what cities go live in what order. In time, our influence will diminish and unlocking cities will be community driven and automated.

Until then, here are some ways you can get our attention to prioritize your city:

1. Sign up an attention-grabbing number of riders and drivers in your city.
2. Think through how the app being live in your city could create or break news.
3. Think through how the app being live in your city would be differentiating.
4. Get local influencers with large social media followings and/or personal brand cachet bought into the project and interested in collaborating on promoting the app to your city.
5. Get local people with relevant skills and experience to launching the app in a city bought into the project. For example, people with experience in corporate rideshare, community organizing, offline marketing, hosting events, tech launches, and more.

The more self-starting you can be on these fronts, the better.

Share your progress regularly on X (tag us [@teleportxyz](https://x.com/teleportxyz)) and on Telegram as well.

#### How can I know when the app is available in my city?

1. Follow us on X. We announce new cities live on the network there.
2. Bookmark the [TRIP Explorer](https://explorer.trip.dev/). In time, we will add the ability to subscribe to a city for updates.

#### How can I help build the network if the app is not available in my city?

If the app is not available in your city, you can still help build the network. Here’s how:

1. Sign up riders and drivers in your city. You can do so even if the app is not available yet.
2. Build relationships with local influencers with large social media followings and/or personal brand cachet. Educate them on the project and get them bought in.
3. Start and host your own events. Organize local people with relevant skills and experience to launching the app in a city.

You can also:

1. Sign up riders and drivers in cities where the app is live. For example, use Facebook Groups, Nextdoor pages, and forums local to the cities where the app is live. You can build relationships and spread the word there.
2. Travel to cities where the app is live. Drive or ride on the network while there. Sign up riders and drivers while there.

#### How can I see the progress of cities going live on the network?

1. Follow us on X. We announce new cities live on the network there.
2. Visit the [TRIP Explorer](https://explorer.trip.dev/). There you can see sign up activity happening all over the world.

#### What if my city is outside the US?

Our goal is to be in as many cities outside the US as possible as soon as possible.

To start, our team will have more influence over what cities go live in what order. In time, our influence will be greatly diminished and unlocking cities will be community driven and automated.

Until then, here are some ways you can get our attention to prioritize your city:

1. Figure out the local licensing and insurance requirements for a rideshare operator.
2. Sign up an attention-grabbing number of riders and drivers in your city.
3. Think through how the app being live in your city could create or break news.
4. Think through how the app being live in your city would be differentiating.
5. Get local influencers with large social media followings and/or personal brand cachet bought into the project and interested in collaborating on promoting the app to your city.
6. Get local people with relevant skills and experience to launching the app in a city bought into the project. For example, people with experience in corporate rideshare, community organizing, offline marketing, hosting events, tech launches, and more.

The more self-starting you can be on these fronts, the better.

Share your progress regularly on X (tag us @teleportxyz) and on Telegram as well.

### How can I best help?

If you think about it signing up operators won’t be the biggest bottleneck.

We will likely only need a few hundred worldwide to have global coverage.

Next signing up drivers will also not be the biggest bottleneck.

Drivers regularly use multiple apps and go to whichever one pays them best.

What’s more, many TRIP community members are ready and willing to drive to earn rewards.

So the biggest bottleneck in the success of the project will be signing up the riders worldwide.

With your help, we’ll make it happen.

#### How can I sign up riders?

In the app:

1. On the "Ride" page find the “Invite to Earn Rewards” card.
2. Either tap the Share button or the QR code button to share your link.

From there, they will:

1. Install the app.
2. Either enter your invite code or scan your QR code again.

They are now signed up as a rider.

#### Are there any tools or materials to help me sign up riders?

Yes, absolutely. Ask in the TRIP Community.

We have templates that can be used to create invite cards, flyers, t-shirts, hoodies, and more.

Here’s one [invite template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1326951456467897303) as an example.

#### What do I get for signing up riders?

You earn TRIP Rewards by signing up riders.

You can also earn TRIP Rewards by signing up drivers or by riding or driving on the network.

#### **What's the best way to tell riders about the app?**

To get someone to try something new, you have to lead with “what’s in it for them”.

Riders will pay less on average for rides. We estimate 15% less.

Riders will earn TRIP Rewards for using the network.

Here are some ways to share these points by word of mouth:

1. In different places: flyers, t-shirts, stickers, car seat sign, X/Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, etc.
2. From different perspectives: Quotes from riders, quotes from drivers, quotes from different kinds of people from all different walks of life in your area. Quotes from local influencers.
3. In different mediums: text, image, video, audio, etc.
4. In different formats: story, list, conversation, ad, etc.

There are many other dimensions of variation you can use to riff even further on these points.

Mix and match them to come up with new and effective ways to spread the word.

Then make sure to share your learnings in the TRIP Community. Not only will that benefit others, it will also benefit you.

The community will give you suggestions to improve your approach further.

### How can I become a driver?

First, make sure you have an invitation and that you have installed the app.

Next in the app:

1. Click “Become a driver” on the "TRIP" tab.

From there you will submit a driver application by answering a few questions.

When your city is ready to go live, you will complete an onboarding process before activating.

#### What kind of questions does the driver application ask?

It asks you questions about what you’re looking for in driving on the app.

For example:

* Where you would like to drive?
* How many days a week would you like to drive?
* How long would you like to drive for in a typical driving session?

#### Do I have to have driven for Uber, Lyft, or another rideshare company before?

No, you don’t have to have driven for a rideshare company before.

#### Can I apply to be a driver before my city is live on the network?

Yes, you can apply to be a driver before your city is live on the network.

#### If I submit a driver application, does that commit me to driving?

No, it does not commit you to driving.

#### What’s required to complete the driver onboarding process?

**Minimum requirements**

There are a few minimum requirements to meet before you can sign up to drive with TRIP:

* Meet the minimum age to drive in your city
* An in-state license is required
* Have at least one year of licensed driving experience in the US
  * (3 years if you are under 25 years old)
* Use an eligible 4-door vehicle

**Required documents**

For your next step, share the following documentation:

* A valid US driver’s license
* Proof of residency in your city, state, or province
* Proof of vehicle insurance if you plan to drive your own car
* A driver profile photo.

**Driver screening**

After signing up, you will complete a screening online.

It will review your driving record and criminal history.

#### Is there a cost for any part of the driver onboarding process?

If you’re a driver, there is no cost to any part of the driver onboarding process.

If you’re an operator, expect to cover the cost of background checks for drivers.

### How can I become an operator?

To become a operator you must meet local licensing and insurance requirements.

Depending on your area, that could mean registering as a Transportation Network Company (TNC) or Transportation Network Provider (TNP) or Fleet Manager.

If you are outside the US, the licensing and insurance requirements might be labeled differently.

We will provide more detailed guidance on this in time.

Google: “Rideshare licensing and insurance requirements {YOUR\_STATE}” for more details.

The Wikipedia article, “[Legality of ridesharing companies by jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality\_of\_ridesharing\_companies\_by\_jurisdiction)”, is helpful as a starting point as well.

#### What specific licenses and insurance do I need to operate in my city?

License and insurance requirements vary from state to state.

We will provide more detailed guidance on this in time.

Google: “Rideshare licensing and insurance requirements {YOUR\_STATE}” for more details.

#### How do I apply for these licenses and insurance?

The application process varies from state to state.

We will provide more detailed guidance on this in time.

Google: “Rideshare licensing and insurance requirements {YOUR\_STATE}” for more details.

#### What is the cost to obtain the licenses and insurance?

The cost varies from state to state.

We will provide more detailed guidance on this in time.

Google: “Rideshare licensing and insurance requirements {YOUR\_STATE}” for more details.

#### **How long does it take to get approved as a TNC, TNP, or Fleet Manager?**

The time it takes to get approved varies from state to state.

It typically takes on the order of weeks—or a few months max.

We will provide more detailed guidance on this in time.

Google: “Rideshare licensing and insurance requirements {YOUR\_STATE}” for more details.

#### **Can I operate in more than one city, state, or country?**

Yes rideshare licensing is typically at the state level in the US.

So once you’re licensed for one state you can operate in any city in that state.

There’s no limitation on getting additional licenses in other states or countries.

#### Can there be multiple operators in one city, state, or country?

Yes, there can be multiple operators in one city, state, or country.

### How can I pay for rides as a rider?

Riders can pay for rides with credit or debit cards.

#### Are there other payment methods I can use as a rider?

In time, we will add support for payment methods like stablecoins.

#### Is it safe to store my payment information in the app?

The security of your payment information is important to us.

All network participants who handle customer payment information must follow PCI standards to safeguard your payment information.

#### **What happens if there’s an issue with my payment after a ride?**

If there’s an issue with your payment, reach out to the operator who facilitated your ride.

They will be able to support you and resolve any issues you might experience.

#### **Can I see a history of my payments for rides?**

Yes. After each ride you will receive an email receipt for your records.

### Is the app built on a blockchain?

Yes, the app is built on the Solana blockchain.

We chose Solana due to the high throughput, low transaction costs, and smart contract support, among other positive properties, that the ecosystem provides.

#### **What is a blockchain, and how does it work?**

A blockchain is a new kind of database.

It’s not hosted by one central party like a company. It’s hosted by a community of people.

Because it’s hosted by a community of people, you don’t need anyone’s permission to access it.

What’s more, due to its design, you can trust that it hasn’t been tampered with.

So not only do you not need permission to access it, you can trust it to be accurate as well.

As a result, blockchains enable people to agree on a “set of facts” as a community.

And because of this, they have created an opportunity to solve problems in new and better ways.

#### **Why is Solana better for the app than other blockchains?**

Solana has high throughput, low transaction costs, and smart contract support.

The decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) community has embraced Solana and led to many real world success stories. If you’re interested in learning more about Solana and DePIN look up projects like Hivemapper, Helium, and Render.

#### **What are smart contracts, and why are they important for the app?**

A smart contract is a computer program that can run on a blockchain like Solana.

We use smart contracts to automate operating aspects of the network.

For example, one or more smart contracts will likely be used to allocate TRIP Rewards weekly.

#### **Does using Solana affect how fast the app works?**

No, our choice of Solana does not affect how fast the app works.

#### **Are there any benefits for users because the app is built on Solana?**

Yes, there are many benefits. Most of them will be not immediately visible to riders and drivers.

#### **Do I need to know anything about blockchains to use the app?**

No, you don’t need to know anything about blockchains to use the app.

#### Will you add support for my favorite L1 or L2 blockchain?

Our mission is to free the rideshare market so that drivers earn more and riders pay less.

We will use the best tools available to achieve our mission quickly and effectively.

We welcome community members making rigorous arguments as to why we should use specific technologies. We are receptive to arguments that speak to achieving our mission.

### Is the app built with onchain technology?

Yes, the app is built on the Solana blockchain.

#### **What is onchain technology, and how does it help users?**

Onchain is a label that’s used to describe a new set of applications for the internet.

Onchain projects typically use decentralization, blockchains, and tokens in useful ways.

In our case, our use of onchain technology allows you to pay less for rides. And for your driver to earn more.

#### **Do I need to know anything about onchain technology to use the app?**

No, you don’t need to know anything about onchain technology to use the app.

#### Will you add support for my favorite onchain technology?

Our mission is to free the rideshare market so that drivers earn more and riders pay less.

We will use the best tools available to achieve our mission quickly and effectively.

We welcome community members making rigorous arguments as to why we should use specific technologies. We are only receptive to arguments that speak to achieving our mission.

#### Will you add support for my favorite DePIN project like Hivemapper? Helium?

Our mission is to free the rideshare market so that drivers earn more and riders pay less.

We will use the best tools available to achieve our mission quickly and effectively.

While we love fellow DePIN projects like Hivemapper and Helium, we want to make sure we adopt tools if and only if they will enable us to better achieve our mission.

We welcome community members making rigorous arguments as to why we should use specific technologies. We are only receptive to arguments that speak to achieving our mission.

### Is the app safe for riders and drivers?

Safety is important to us.

Everyone in our rideshare network, including drivers, riders, and operators, needs to follow certain steps to make sure they can use our network safely.

Here's what happens:

* **Operators** (people who manage drivers and riders in different places) need to get the right licenses and insurance. They have to meet all safety rules before they can operate.
* **Drivers and Riders** also need to follow all safety rules. If they don't, they could also face penalties or be removed from the network.

#### **What is the authorization process for operators, drivers and riders?**

Operators are authorized by dedicated compliance auditing firms.

These firms receive authorization by multi-sig keys to sign off on the regulatory and operational readiness of Operators. Operators are authorized on-chain.

Drivers and riders are authenticated off-chain to preserve privacy and control.

A network participant called a Verifier is responsible for authorizing drivers and riders.

#### **How can operators meet all regulatory and safety requirements?**

Operators can meet all regulatory and safety requirements by ensuring they follow all the rules and regulations required of them by being a licensed and insured rideshare operator in their area.

We will provide more detailed guidance on this in time.

Google: “Rideshare licensing and insurance requirements {YOUR\_STATE}” for more details.

#### **What kind of penalties are faced for not following the rules?**

Penalties could include temporary suspensions or permanent removal from the network. Rules around banning drivers and riders vary from state by state.

#### **Is there a way to rejoin the network if previously removed?**

In some cases, there will be a path to rejoining the network if previously removed.

#### **How does the app monitor and enforce these safety regulations?**

Safety regulations are monitored and enforced by a number of actors on the network.

These include:

* Auditors.
* Verifiers.
* Operators.
* Riders and Drivers.

All safety measures on TRIP are at least as exhaustive as those of legacy rideshare companies.

### How can I follow development?

1. Follow us on X. We announce new development there.
2. Download the app. We release updates there regularly.
3. Visit the [TRIP Explorer](https://explorer.trip.dev/). There you can see the network grow around the world.

#### Do you have a public roadmap?

We do not have a public roadmap.

Is there a project that has a great product roadmap you like?

Let us know in the TRIP Community on Telegram. We’d love to see examples.

#### **Where can I find the TRIP Community on Telegram?**

Join us here: [https://trip.dev/chat](https://trip.dev/chat)

#### **What kind of updates can I expect in the app?**

Updates that make the app akin to driving or riding with traditional rideshare companies.

#### **How often do you post new developments on X?**

We post new developments on X on a weekly basis.

#### **Can anyone access the TRIP Explorer, or do I need an account?**

Anyone can access the TRIP Explorer. No account is needed at this time.

We may add account creation in the future to offer more personalized features.

#### How can I use the **TRIP Explorer to follow the network's growth?**

The TRIP Explorer currently shows sign ups happening around the world.

US States that are green have at least one licensed operator present.

In time, we will add more features to the TRIP Explorer so you can see which cities are live, which are close to being live, and where the most activity is happening.
