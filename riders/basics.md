# Rider Basics

## **Introduction**

### What is a Rider on TRIP?

A Rider on TRIP is an individual who uses the Teleport app to request and pay for rides. Riders are matched with nearby drivers who transport them to their desired destinations in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner.

### Benefits of Using the TRIP Protocol

TRIP offers a convenient and cost-effective way to travel, with the flexibility to request rides at any time. Riders benefit from competitive pricing, the ability to earn rewards, and the assurance of traveling with drivers who meet strict safety and vehicle standards.

## Getting Started

### How to Sign Up

To sign up as a rider, download the Teleport app, get an invite, and create an account. You’ll need to provide basic information such as your name, email address, and phone number. Once your account is set up, you’re ready to start requesting rides.

### Payment Methods

Riders can pay for rides with credit/debit cards or Apple Pay. We recommend using Apple Pay. If you don't have Apple Pay set up, it takes only a few moments to add a card for ongoing use and quickly booking rides.

## Role Responsibilities

### Requesting Rides

As a rider, you are able to request rides through the Teleport app. Simply enter your destination, review the estimated fare, and confirm your request. The app will match you with the nearest available driver.

Make sure you are ready and at the designated pick-up location before your driver arrives. This helps avoid delays and ensures a smooth pick-up process.&#x20;

Additionally, double-check that the pick-up location entered in the app is accurate to prevent any confusion. If you need to make any changes to the pick-up spot or timing, communicate these updates to your driver promptly through the app's messaging feature.&#x20;

Being punctual and clear with your instructions contributes to a better experience for both you and your driver.

### Communicating with Drivers

Clear and respectful communication with your driver is key to a smooth ride experience.&#x20;

Use the in-app messaging feature if necessary to coordinate pick-up details or communicate any special requests.

### Providing Feedback

As a rider, your feedback is valuable in helping us improve.&#x20;

You can submit feature requests and participate in discussions around existing suggestions at the [Teleport Feedback](https://feedback.teleport.xyz/) board. Engaging with the community in this way allows you to influence future updates and share your ideas for enhancing the service.

## Using the App

### Booking a Ride

To book a ride, open the app, enter your pick-up location and destination, and confirm your request. The app will show you the estimated fare and match you with a nearby driver. You can track your driver’s arrival in real-time.

### Tracking Your Ride

Once your ride is confirmed, you can track the progress of your driver as they make their way to your pick-up location. During the ride, the app will provide live updates on your route and estimated arrival time.

### Resolving Ride Issues

If you encounter any issues during your ride, you can use the app’s support feature to report the problem. Teleport's support team is available to help resolve any issues promptly.

## Pricing and Rewards

### Fare Breakdown

Fares in the Teleport app are calculated based on a combination of factors, including distance, time, and any applicable surcharges. You can view the fare breakdown in the app before and after your trip, ensuring full transparency.

### TRIP Rewards

TRIP Rewards are digital collectibles that riders claim for riding or inviting other active riders and drivers. The more you ride and the more the people you invite ride and drive, the more TRIP Rewards you earn. Riders can hold their TRIP Rewards or sell them directly in the app.

### Cashing Out

Earnings from TRIP Rewards can be cashed out by connecting a bank account in the app. Alternatively, riders can export their private key from the app and access their funds in a wallet app like Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare.

## Community and Support

### TRIP Community

Join the [TRIP community](https://trip.dev/chat) to connect with other riders, share experiences, and stay updated on the latest news and features. The community offers a platform for riders to engage and provide feedback on the service.

### Contacting Support

Support is available through the app for any questions or issues. The in-app help center provides guides and troubleshooting tips.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Common Rider Questions

#### What should I do if I leave something in my car?

If you leave an item in the car, reach out to support in the app for assistance in retrieving your belongings.&#x20;

#### How do I cancel a ride?

Riders can cancel the ride at any time before the ride starts. Riders do not incur charges for the trip if canceled. Once the driver has started the trip, riders can no longer cancel the trip. At that point, riders are responsible for paying the full fare.

### Troubleshooting App Issues

If you experience issues with the Teleport app, such as difficulty booking a ride or problems with payment, first try restarting the app or your device. If the issue persists, contact support in the app for further assistance.

## Advanced Tips and Tricks

### Maximizing TRIP Rewards

To maximize your TRIP rewards, you can actively and passively earn miles. Actively earning miles involves riding as much as possible. The more revenue you contribute by riding, the more miles you accumulate, increasing your rewards.

On the passive side, inviting others to join TRIP can significantly boost your miles. If you refer drivers from other apps, you'll earn miles every time they drive, even if you’re not the one riding with them. Similarly, by referring rider friends, you'll earn miles whenever they ride. Furthermore, if the people you invite also refer others, you'll earn miles for every ride or drive their referrals make. Encouraging your referrals to invite others can create a network effect, allowing you to earn even more passive miles.
