# Rider Basics

## **Rider Cancellations**

* **Driver en route to a pickup:** Riders can cancel the ride at any time before the ride starts. The rider does not incur charges for the trip.
* **After pickup:** The rider can no longer cancel the trip once the driver has started the ride. The rider is responsible for paying the full fare.
