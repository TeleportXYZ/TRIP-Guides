# TRIP Miles for Drivers

## Introduction

The more ride revenue that flows through TRIP, the more successful the network becomes. To incentivize you as a driver to contribute towards this goal, you earn TRIP Miles for every ride you complete, whether directly by driving or indirectly through referring other active drivers or riders.&#x20;

TRIP Miles are redeemable for digital collectibles that you can either hold or sell within the app. These digital collectibles can serve as a marker of a your contribution as a driver to the success of the TRIP network, allowing you to showcase your efforts in driving and helping to grow the community.

## How Drivers Earn TRIP Miles

### Driving and Completing Rides

As a driver, you earn TRIP Miles directly each time you drive and complete rides. The amount earned is proportional to the ride fare, meaning that higher fares result in more TRIP Miles. This is the fastest and most straightforward way for you as a driver to accumulate TRIP Miles.

### Inviting Others to Ride or Drive

As a driver, you can also earn TRIP Miles by inviting others to ride or drive on TRIP. Whenever someone you invite completes a trip—whether as a driver or rider—you earn TRIP Miles based on their activity. The higher the fare and the more frequent their trips—whether they drive or ride—the more TRIP Miles you earn from their activity. Additionally, you earn TRIP Miles from the activity of riders and drivers referred by your referrals. The further down the referral chain, the fewer TRIP Miles you earn per trip, but these can add up quickly, especially if you have a large, engaged network.

### Earning Rollover Miles

A fixed number of TRIP Miles are apportioned each minute to individuals who contributed to completed rides during that time. If no rides are completed during a minute, the TRIP Miles roll over to the next minute. This rollover can accumulate up to a 180x multiplier as long as no rides take place. This mechanism can significantly boost a your TRIP Miles earnings as a driver, particularly during less busy times. To maximize rollover miles, it is beneficial for you to be on the road early and often, increasing your chances of completing a ride when the rollover multiplier is in effect.

## Detailed Breakdown of Referral Earnings

**Direct Referrals:** Every time one of your referrals rides or drives, you’ll earn about 40% of the TRIP Miles that the rider or driver you referred earned for that trip. This is a significant way to boost your TRIP Miles passively.

**Indirect Referrals (Second Level):** Every time one of your referral’s referrals rides or drives, you’ll earn about 13% of the TRIP Miles that the rider or driver earned for that trip. While the per-trip amount is smaller, the broader your network, the more these miles can really add up.

**Tertiary Referrals (Third Level):** Every time one of your indirect referral’s referrals rides or drives, you’ll earn about 5% of the TRIP Miles that the rider or driver earned for that trip. Even with greatly reduced earnings per trip, having a large and active third-level network can provide a steady stream of TRIP Miles.

## Maximizing TRIP Miles

To maximize TRIP Miles as a driver, focus on both driving frequently and building a strong referral network. Engaging with your riders from traditional rideshare apps, explaining the benefits of riding with TRIP, and encouraging them to switch over for their next ride can be highly effective. Similarly, engaging with other drivers you know from traditional rideshare apps, explaining the benefits of driving with TRIP, and encouraging them to invite their own network can also yield significant results. The more active your referral chain, the more TRIP Miles you stand to earn as a driver, creating a passive stream of TRIP Miles that complements your regular earnings from driving.

## Using TRIP Miles to Claim TRIP Rewards

As a driver, you can use your TRIP Miles to claim TRIP Rewards. These digital collectibles serve as a marker of your contribution to the success of the TRIP network. You can choose to hold these rewards or sell them within the app. If you decide to sell a reward, you can transfer the funds to your bank account if you would like.

## Conclusion

TRIP Miles offer you as a driver a unique way to earn and benefit from your contributions to the TRIP network. By understanding how to earn and maximize TRIP Miles, you can significantly enhance your earnings. Whether through driving or building a strong referral network, the opportunities to earn are substantial. You can make the most of your TRIP experience by actively engaging with these earning strategies and leveraging rewards effectively.
