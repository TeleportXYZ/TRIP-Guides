# Driver Basics

## **Introduction**

### What is a Driver on TRIP?

A Driver on TRIP is a key part of our rideshare ecosystem, responsible for providing transportation services to riders using the Teleport app. Drivers use their own vehicles to pick up riders and transport them to their destinations.

### Benefits of Being a Driver

Being a driver offers flexible working hours and the potential for high earnings, especially during peak hours. It also provides an opportunity to meet new people and explore different areas while earning TRIP Rewards for additional benefits.

## Getting Started

### Driver Requirements

[First, you need to meet the minimum age to drive in your city and possess a valid driver's license. You should have at least one year of licensed driving experience in the US, or three years if you are under 25 years old. Additionally, you must use an eligible 4-door vehicle to ensure passenger comfort and safety.](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

### Sign-Up Process

To sign up as a driver, start by downloading the Teleport app and creating an account. Next, tap "Become a Driver" on the "TRIP" tab. Complete the online application, providing both your personal and vehicle information. Finally, undergo a background check and wait for approval to start driving.

### Going Online as a Driver

After approval, log in to the Teleport app. On the "Ride" tab, tap the dropdown arrow to toggle over to the Driver view of the app. Tap "Go Online" to start accepting ride requests.

## Role Responsibilities

### Providing Safe and Reliable Rides

Drivers must adhere to traffic laws, drive safely, and ensure their vehicle is clean and well-maintained. Following the suggested route by supported mapping app is important unless the rider requests a different route.

### Communication with Riders

Clear and polite communication with riders is essential. Confirm rider details before starting the trip and handle any concerns or questions professionally.

### Maintaining Vehicle Standards

Regular servicing and maintenance of the vehicle is expected. Keeping the vehicle clean and ensuring all safety features are functional is important.

## Insurance Coverage

Understanding how insurance coverage works is crucial for drivers using the T[^2]eleport app. Here’s an overview of the insurance provisions currently in place in the state of Texas:

### **Offline Coverage**

When you are not driving for the service, your own personal auto insurance applies. This means that your regular insurance policy covers you during all non-working hours.

### **Insurance Policy Holder**

The insurance policy for TRIP drivers is held by Denali Mobility LLC, a TRIP Operator approved in the state of Texas. This ensures that all necessary insurance requirements are met, providing you with peace of mind while you drive.

### **Online and Waiting for a Trip**

While you are online and waiting for a trip request, Denali Mobility LLC provides coverage up to $50,000 for individual bodily injuries and $100,000 per accident. Additionally, property damage is covered up to $25,000 per accident. It’s important to note that this coverage is contingent on the excess liability of your personal auto insurance.

### **During a Trip or Driving to Pick Up a Passenger**

During a trip or when you are driving to pick up a passenger, Denali Mobility LLC's insurance covers third-party damages in compliance with Texas TNC guidelines. If your vehicle is damaged, repair costs are covered up to its actual cash value of $50,000, with a deductible of $2,500. This coverage applies only if your personal policy includes comprehensive and collision coverage.

## Using the App

### Accepting and Completing Rides

Ride requests are received through the app. Drivers can accept or decline requests. Drivers can also cancel rides before the rider has been picked up whereby the rider will receive a full refund. After pick up, the driver is unable to cancel the ride. To end the ride, the driver must complete the ride and will receive full payment.

### Navigation Tools

The app can integrate with popular mapping apps on your phone like Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze and more. Apple CarPlay is supported as well. Use the supported maps for optimal routing. Familiarity with alternative routes in case of traffic or road closures is also beneficial.

### Handling Ride Issues

Use your good judgment and common sense when resolving disputes with riders and contact support when you feel it's necessary. Any incidents or issues can be reported through the app. From the "Profile" tab, tap "Help Center" and then "Contact Us".&#x20;

## Earnings and Rewards

### Fare Calculation

Fares are calculated based on a combination of base fare, distance, time, and surge pricing. Drivers can keep track of their earnings with the app’s wallet balance.

### TRIP Rewards

The more ride revenue that flows through TRIP, the more successful the network becomes. To incentivize you as a driver to contribute toward this goal, you earn TRIP Miles for every drive you take, whether directly by using TRIP or indirectly through referring other active riders or drivers.&#x20;

TRIP Miles are redeemable for TRIP Rewards which are digital collectibles that you can either hold or sell within the app. Check out [TRIP Miles for Drivers](trip-miles-for-drivers.md) to learn more.

### Cashing Out

Earnings can be cashed out by connecting a bank account in the app. Alternatively, drivers can export their private key from the app and access their funds in a wallet app like Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare.

## Community and Support

### TRIP Community

TRIP offers a supportive community for drivers. Joining the [TRIP community](https://trip.dev/chat) allows you to share experiences and tips, participate in conversations, local meetups, and online groups.

### Contacting Support

Support is available through the app for any questions or issues. The in-app help center provides guides and troubleshooting tips.
