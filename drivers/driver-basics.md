## **Insurance Coverage**

Here's how insurance coverage works today in the state of Texas.

### **Offline Coverage**

When you're not driving for the service, your own personal auto insurance applies.

### **Online and Waiting for a Trip**

* Up to $50,000 for individual bodily injuries and $100,000 per accident.
* Property damage coverage up to $25,000 per accident.
* Coverage is contingent on the excess liability of your personal auto insurance

### **During a Trip or Driving to Pick Up a Passenger**

* Third-party damages compliant with Texas TNC guidelines.
* Your vehicle repair costs are covered up to its actual cash value of $50,000, with a deductible of $2,500, contingent on your personal policy including comprehensive and collision coverage.

### Insurance Policy Holder
