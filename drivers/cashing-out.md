# Cashing Out

### Overview

Driving with TRIP, you get paid in USD Coin (or USDC).

To convert your USDC into cash in your bank account, you need two things:

* A free onchain wallet
* A free account on a exchange.

The onchain wallet allows you to send your USDC to a exchange.

The exchange allows you to send your USDC to your bank account.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set both of these up and cash out your earnings.

### Creating your onchain wallet

If you have an existing onchain wallet, you can use that.

To create your  wallet:

1.

### Creating your exchange account

If you have an existing exchange account, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) for your exchange.

To create your Coinbase account:

1. Download the Coinbase iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether/id886427730).
2. In the app, follow the onboarding steps to create a free account.

Coinbase requires the following to create an account:

* Be at least 18 years old.
* A [valid photo ID](https://help.coinbase.com/en-au/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/id-doc-verification).
* A passport, medicare card, or driver's license.
* A computer or smartphone connected to the internet.
* A phone number connected to your smartphone (we'll send SMS text messages).
* The latest version of the Coinbase app.

When prompted to add your bank account, go ahead and add that now. That way, you wonâ€™t have to add it when you cash out later.

### Cashing Out

With your onchain wallet and exchange accounts created, you're now ready to cash out.

**To send your earnings from your onchain wallet to your exchange account:**

1. Next within the Coinbase app, click **Send & Receive.** Then click **Receive.**
2. Select **USD Coin** at the top. Switch the **Network** to Solana.
3. Copy the USDC wallet address shown to your clipboard.
4.
5. Paste the USDC wallet address you copied from Coinbase here.
6. Select USDC to send. Enter the amount to send. Confirm send.

Now to cash out, back in the Coinbase app, simply click **Cash Out** to withdraw your earnings to your linked bank account.
