# Cashing Out

## Overview

Driving with TRIP, there are two ways to cash out your earnings:

1. Transfer to your bank account (recommended).
2. Transfer from a third party wallet (advanced).

This guide will walk you through how to use both options.

## Transfer to your bank account

The simplest way to cash out is transferring to your bank account.

In the Teleport app:

1. In the bottom right corner, tap Profile.
2. In the top right corner, tap the green button displaying your earnings.
3. Tap Cash Out.
4. Select Bank Transfer.
5. Provide some additional information to connect your bank account.
6. Back in the Teleport app, tap Instant or Standard.
   * Instant takes a few minutes for your earnings to land in your bank account. This option has a 2% fee (with a minimum fee of $2).
   * Standard takes 1-3 business days for your earnings to land in your bank account. This option is free.
7. Tap Transfer.

That's it! Your earnings are on the way.

## Transfer from a third party wallet

Driving with TRIP, you get paid in a stablecoin called USDC. USDC is like a digital dollar.

If you want to access your earnings in USDC format, you need two things:

* A free third party wallet (like Solflare).
* A free account on an exchange (like Coinbase).

The wallet allows you to send your USDC to the exchange.

The exchange allows you to access your USDC to use, trade, or convert it to cash.

In this section, you'll learn how to set both of these up and access your earnings.

### Creating your third party wallet

If you have an existing third party wallet with Solana support, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend creating a wallet with Solflare.

To create your Solflare wallet:

1. Download the Solflare iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solflare-solana-wallet/id1580902717).
2. In the Solflare app, tap Import Wallet. It should ask for a recovery phrase.
3. Open the Teleport App and tap **Profile** in the bottom menu bar.
4. Tap the green **Wallet** button in the top right of the screen.
5. Copy and paste your secret phrase into your Solflare wallet (or another wallet you are using). The secret phrase is the same thing as the recovery phrase.
6. Within the Solflare app, paste in your secret phrase. You may have to tap "Allow Paste".&#x20;
7. Tap Confirm. If it says No Active Wallets Found, tap Quick setup to continue.
8. Follow the rest of the onboarding steps (creating a passcode, etc).&#x20;

You should now see your earnings in Solflare.

### Creating your exchange account

If you have an existing exchange account, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) for your exchange.

To create your Coinbase account:

1. Download the Coinbase iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether/id886427730).
2. In the app, follow the onboarding steps to create a free account.

Coinbase requires the following to create an account:

* Be at least 18 years old.
* A [valid photo ID](https://help.coinbase.com/en-au/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/id-doc-verification).
* A passport, medicare card, or driver's license.
* A computer or smartphone connected to the internet.
* A phone number connected to your smartphone (we'll send SMS text messages).
* The latest version of the Coinbase app.

When prompted to add your bank account, go ahead and add that now.&#x20;

That way, you wonâ€™t have to add it if you want to cash out with this method later.

### Transfer your earnings to your exchange account

With your third party wallet and exchange accounts created, you're almost finished.

**To transfer your earnings from your third party wallet to your exchange account:**

1. Within the Coinbase app, click **Send & Receive.** Then click **Receive.**
2. Select **USD Coin** at the top. Switch the **Network** to Solana.
3. Copy the USDC wallet address shown to your clipboard.
4. Now back in the Solflare app, click into your USDC balance, click **Send.**
5. Paste the USDC wallet address you copied from Coinbase here.
6. Select USDC to send. Enter the amount to send. Confirm send.

Now you can use, trade, or even cash out your USDC from Coinbase.

To cash out, back in the Coinbase app, simply click **Cash Out** to withdraw your earnings to your linked bank account.
