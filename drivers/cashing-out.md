# Cashing Out

## Overview

There are two ways to cash out your driver earnings:

1. Direct deposit to your bank account (recommended).
2. Transfer from a third party wallet (advanced).

This guide will go through both options to cash out your earnings.

## Direct deposit to your bank account

The simplest way to cash out is direct deposit to your bank account.

In the Teleport app:

1. Tap Profile in the bottom right corner.
2. Tap the green button displaying your earnings in the top right corner.
3. Tap Cash Out.
4. Select Bank Transfer.
5. If this is your first time, you will be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity. Once you have done so, you will be able to connect your bank account.
6. Once back in the Teleport app, tap Instant or Standard.
   * Instant takes a few minutes for your earnings to land in your bank account. This option has a 2% fee (with a minimum fee of $2).
   * Standard takes 1-3 business days for your earnings to land in your bank account. This option is free.
7. Tap Transfer.

That's it! Your money is on the way.

## Transfer from a third party wallet

To use this method to cash out your USDC to your bank account, you need two things:

* A free third party wallet (like Solflare).
* A free account on an exchange (like Coinbase).

The third party wallet allows you to send your USDC to an exchange.

The exchange allows you to convert your USDC to US dollars in your bank account.

Let's learn how to set both of these up to cash out your earnings.

### Creating your third party wallet

If you have an existing third party wallet with Solana support, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend creating a wallet with Solflare.

To create your Solflare wallet:

1. Download the Solflare iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/solflare-solana-wallet/id1580902717).
2. In the Solflare app, tap Import Wallet. It should ask for a recovery phrase.
3. Open the Teleport App and tap **Profile** in the bottom menu bar.
4. Tap the green **Wallet** button in the top right of the screen.
5. Copy and paste your secret phrase into your Solflare wallet (or another wallet you are using). The secret phrase is the same thing as the recovery phrase.
6. Within the Solflare app, paste in your secret phrase. You may have to tap "Allow Paste".&#x20;
7. Tap Confirm. If it says No Active Wallets Found, tap Quick setup to continue.
8. Follow the rest of the onboarding steps (creating a passcode, etc).&#x20;

You should now see your earnings in Solflare.

### Creating your exchange account

If you have an existing exchange account, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) for your exchange.

To create your Coinbase account:

1. Download the Coinbase iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether/id886427730).
2. In the app, follow the onboarding steps to create a free account.

Coinbase requires the following to create an account:

* Be at least 18 years old.
* A [valid photo ID](https://help.coinbase.com/en-au/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/id-doc-verification).
* A passport, medicare card, or driver's license.
* A computer or smartphone connected to the internet.
* A phone number connected to your smartphone (we'll send SMS text messages).
* The latest version of the Coinbase app.

When prompted to add your bank account, go ahead and add that now.&#x20;

That way, you wonâ€™t have to add it when you cash out later.

### Transfer your earnings to your exchange account

With your third party wallet and exchange accounts created, you're almost finished.

**To transfer your earnings from your third party wallet to your exchange account:**

1. Within the Coinbase app, click **Send & Receive.** Then click **Receive.**
2. Select **USD Coin** at the top. Switch the **Network** to Solana.
3. Copy the USDC wallet address shown to your clipboard.
4. Now back in the Solflare app, click into your USDC balance, click **Send.**
5. Paste the USDC wallet address you copied from Coinbase here.
6. Select USDC to send. Enter the amount to send. Confirm send.

Now to cash out, back in the Coinbase app, simply click **Cash Out** to withdraw your earnings to your linked bank account.
