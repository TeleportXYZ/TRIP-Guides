# Cashing Out

### Overview

Drivers on the TRIP get paid in USD Coin (USDC). This is held in your Teleport wallet (a non-custodial Solana wallet).&#x20;

There are two ways to convert USDC in your Teleport wallet to cash your bank account:

1. Withdraw directly to your bank account
2. Connect another Solana wallet and access your funds from there

This guide will go through both options cash out your earnings.

### (I) Cashing out to your bank account

We've partnered with [Coinflow](https://coinflow.cash/) to give you the ability to cash out USDC directly into your bank account.&#x20;

To get started from the Teleport app:

1. Go to the Profile tab and select the green wallet pill on the top right
2. Tap on Cash Out button
3. Select the Bank Transfer option
4. If this your first time, you will be taken through Coinflow's KYC onboarding process in your browser. Once you complete this, you will be able to connect your bank accounts before being brought back to the Teleport app.
5. Once you've completed the onboarding and have added your bank accounts, you will have two options on how to cash out your USDC: Instant or via Standard
   * Instant payouts settle within minutes, meaning you will see it hit your bank account almost instantly. This option has a 2% fee (with a minimum fee of $2).
   * Standard ACH is free for all users and will take the usual 1-3 business days for the funds to each your account.
6. When you hit Transfer, we start the process immediately and your money is on it's way.



### (II) Connect a wallet

To start you need an existing onchain wallet. If you don't have one you can easily get started with popular ones like: [Phantom](https://phantom.app/download), [Solflare](https://solflare.com/) or [Backpack](https://backpack.app/).&#x20;

All of these apps allow you to import a wallet, before you do so you need to get your private key from the Teleport app.

To get your private key from the Teleport app:

1. Go to the Profile tab and select the green wallet pill on the top right
2. Tap on Cash Out button
3. Select the Connect Wallet option
4. Tap View Secret Phrase
5. Copy the seed phrase to clipboard
