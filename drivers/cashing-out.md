# Cashing Out

### Overview

Driving with TRIP, you get paid in USD Coin (or USDC). To convert your USDC into cash in your bank account, you need two things: a free web3 wallet and a free account on a web3 exchange. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to set both of these up and cash out your earnings. You can also learn more about web3 wallets [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/web3-fundamentals-security/basics-to-web3-wallets).

### What you’ll need

Before we go into the step by step of cashing out, there are a couple things you’ll need to have ready before you can cash out.

#### 1. Creating your web3 wallet

Download the [Ottr](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ottr-wallet/id1628669270) App, create a free account and wallet following the [onboarding steps](https://help.ottr.finance/hc/en-us/articles/8847235037979-Getting-Started).

We recommend using Ottr due to their simple and intuitive experience. Ottr also does not require SOL in your wallet in order to send USDC like most other wallets.\*

#### 2. Creating your web3 exchange account

Download the [Coinbase App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether/id886427730) and [create a free account](https://help.coinbase.com/en-au/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/create-a-coinbase-account). Coinbase requires the following to create an account:

* Be at least 18 years old
* A [valid photo ID](https://help.coinbase.com/en-au/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/id-doc-verification)
* A passport, medicare card, or driver's licence
* A computer or smartphone connected to the internet
* A phone number connected to your smartphone (we'll send SMS text messages)
* The latest Coinbase app version

When prompted to add your bank account, you can do so now so you won’t have to add it when you go to cash out.

Y_ou will use Coinbase to transfer your funds to your bank account after receiving them from Ottr (or your preferred Solana wallet). You can alternatively use any other exchange that supports SOL and USDC (Solana Network)_

### Cashing Out&#x20;

#### 1. Exporting your Teleport Wallet

The first step will require you to export your wallet to Ottr by copying your secret phrase (private key) either by writing it down on paper or copying it to your clipboard.  (You will only have to do this one time).

1. Open the Teleport App and tap **Profile** in the bottom menu bar.
2. Tap the green **Wallet** button in the top right of the screen.
3. An explanation of your secret phrase and privacy notice will pop up. Read this and then tap **Show Secret Phrase.**
4. You can now view your secret phrase, **copy to clipboard** or write it down. Make sure you do not share this with anyone as it will give them full control of your funds and wallet.
5. Once copied, you will now open the Ottr App (or Solana wallet app of your choice)
6. From the Ottr app, in the top middle you can see your current wallet. Tap this to open the **wallet menu**. (If you’re using another Solana wallet, find the import/add/connect wallet button usually associated with you wallet menu.)
7. Tap I**mport Wallet**. Enter your secret phrase and tap **Import Wallet**. Your earnings will now appear in the Ottr app.

#### 2.     Send earnings to a web3 exchange and withdrawing to your bank account

Next, you will send your USDC earnings to Coinbase to cash out.

1. Find your receiving Coinbase wallet address in the Coinbase app

* Click **Send & Receive**, click **Receive**
* Select **USD Coin** at the top
* Switch the **Network** to Solana
* Copy the USDC wallet address shown or scan the QR code
* In the Ottr app, click into your USDC balance, click **Send**
* Enter the receiving wallet address
* Select USDC to send, enter the amount to send
* Confirm send
* In the Coinbase app, you can now withdraw your USDC earnings to your linked Bank account by clicking **Cash Out**
