# Cashing Out

### Overview

Driving with TRIP, you get paid in USD Coin (or USDC).&#x20;

To convert your USDC into cash in your bank account, you need two things:&#x20;

* A free onchain wallet
* A free account on a onchain exchange.&#x20;

The onchain wallet allows you to send your USDC to a onchain exchange.

The onchain exchange allows you to send your USDC to your bank account.

In this guide, you'll learn how to set both of these up and cash out your earnings.

### Creating your onchain wallet

If you have an existing onchain wallet, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend creating a onchain wallet with [Ottr](https://ottr.finance/).

To create your Ottr wallet:

1. Download the Ottr iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ottr-wallet/id1628669270).
2. In the app, follow the onboarding steps to create your wallet.

### Creating your onchain exchange account

If you have an existing onchain exchange account, you can use that.

If you don't, we recommend [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) for your onchain exchange.

To create your Coinbase account:

1. Download the Coinbase iOS app [(click here)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether/id886427730).
2. In the app, follow the onboarding steps to create a free account.

Coinbase requires the following to create an account:

* Be at least 18 years old.
* A [valid photo ID](https://help.coinbase.com/en-au/coinbase/getting-started/getting-started-with-coinbase/id-doc-verification).
* A passport, medicare card, or driver's license.
* A computer or smartphone connected to the internet.
* A phone number connected to your smartphone (we'll send SMS text messages).
* The latest version of the Coinbase app.

When prompted to add your bank account, go ahead and add that now. That way, you wonâ€™t have to add it when you cash out later.

### Cashing Out

With your onchain wallet and onchain exchange accounts created, you're now ready to cash out.
