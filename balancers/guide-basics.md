# Balancer Basics

As a Balancer, you can bring the TRIP protocol to your city by referring others in your city to form an atomic network of riders and drivers. Every successful referral is recorded in the Teleport app.&#x20;

You can track how your city compares against other cities below!

More cities will be added to this list and estimates may change.&#x20;
