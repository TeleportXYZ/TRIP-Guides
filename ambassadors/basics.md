# Ambassador Basics

## Introduction

### What is an Ambassador on TRIP?

An Ambassador on TRIP plays a crucial role in expanding the TRIP network by promoting the Teleport app and building a local community of riders and drivers. Ambassadors are the frontline advocates who help grow the TRIP protocol in cities around the world.

### Benefits of Being an Ambassador

As an Ambassador, you gain the opportunity to be a key part of TRIP's growth and success in your city. You can earn TRIP Miles and Rewards for your efforts, develop valuable networking skills, and contribute to the decentralized future of transportation. Additionally, Ambassadors have access to various promotional tools and resources to support their outreach efforts.

## Getting Started

You don't need permission to be a TRIP Ambassador.&#x20;

If you feel strongly about TRIP, simply get out there and spread the word!

## Role Responsibilities

### Promoting the App

As an Ambassador, your primary responsibility is to promote the TRIP app within your city.&#x20;

This includes distributing promotional materials, sharing information about TRIP’s benefits, and encouraging people to download and use the Teleport app.&#x20;

You can personalize promotional items such as seat placards, flyers, postcards, business cards, and even t-shirts with your unique QR code to sign up riders and drivers.

### Engaging with Potential Users

Engagement is key to success as an Ambassador.&#x20;

You should actively interact with potential users, answering their questions, explaining the benefits of TRIP, and providing support as they sign up. Building relationships within your community is essential for forming a strong local community of riders and drivers.

### Reporting and Feedback

Ambassadors are encouraged to share their activities and provide feedback on their experiences in the TRIP Community on Telegram.&#x20;

Contributing to the improvement of TRIP’s guides and resources is also recommended. If you encounter any typos, factual errors, or incomplete content in TRIP documentation, you are encouraged to make edits or open an issue for discussion in the TRIP Community.

## Using the App

### Ambassador Tools

The Teleport app provides a range of tools to help you manage your referrals and promotional activities. You can track the success of your referrals, view real-time data on your network’s growth, and access resources to aid in your promotional efforts.

### Tracking Invites

Every successful invite is recorded in the Teleport app, allowing you to monitor your impact on TRIP’s expansion. Use this data to optimize your strategies and focus on areas where you can make the most significant difference.&#x20;

We use rideshare simulations to estimate the atomic network for each city. Studying these sign up targets can help you focus your promotional efforts effectively.

Right now, there might not be an estimate for your specific city.

In that case, look for a similar city to get an idea of how many riders and drivers will be needed.

We will add more cities to this list and update the estimates over time. Check back regularly.

## Earnings and Rewards

### TRIP Rewards

TRIP Rewards are digital collectibles that ambassadors claim for inviting active riders and drivers. The more the people you invite ride and drive, the more TRIP Rewards you earn. Moreover, if the people you invite also invite active riders and drivers, you will earn Rewards when those people ride and drive too.

Ambassadors can hold their TRIP Rewards or sell them directly in the app.

### Cashing Out

Earnings from TRIP Rewards can be cashed out by connecting a bank account in the app. Alternatively, riders can export their private key from the app and access their funds in a wallet app like Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare.

## Community and Support

### TRIP Community

As an Ambassador, you are part of a larger community of TRIP advocates. Engage with other Ambassadors and users through the global [TRIP Community](https://trip.dev/chat) as well as your local TRIP Community on Telegram. Yes, there is a specific TRIP Telegram group for each U.S. state and most countries around the world so people can meet, organize, and collaborate together. You can find a list of all these local communities in the "Want to see TRIP in your city?" channel in the global TRIP Community.&#x20;

The TRIP Community is a valuable resource for sharing experiences, gaining insights, and staying updated on the latest developments.
